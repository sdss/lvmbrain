    Parameters
    ----------
    actors
        The actor or actors to restart.
    gort
        The Gort instance. Used to refresh the command set in the affected actors.
    post_restart_actions
        Whether to run post-restart actions. This may include resetting spectrographs,
        homing devices, etc.
    timeout
        The timeout in seconds to wait for the restart to complete.
